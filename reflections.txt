You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

## What new skills have you learned?

From this lesson, I have learned the importance of using semantic tagging of content that is afforded by newer HTML5 elements. I learned about how to use appropriate elements for sectioning content, inline text semantics and tags to use for images. 

From looking at resources from Mozilla Developer Docs I also was able to find tangebale concepts such as HTML5 outline algorithm and implicit headings.

## What has been easy?

Some of tags for inline text semantics and sectioning elements were easy to identify and apply to tags to, such as paragraph tags and article tags.

## What has been difficult?

Choosing the correct semantic tags can be a difficult challange, especially when multiple tags seems to applicable for certain pieces of content.

Also, I found it challenging when nesting tags because I was fearful of what the SEO/semantic outcome would be.

## How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I used some of the following problem solving strategies: 

1. Utilized the MDN HTML elements resource to look, and tangent material
2. Using a validator to make sure that after all the tags were applies that it meet HTML5 validation
3. Research on the various tags and their corresponding semantic definitions
4. Looking at other peoples code to review and check my own approach to solving the challenge.
5. finally checking my work against the rubric outlined for this particular challenge
